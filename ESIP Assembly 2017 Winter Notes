- -_Constitution & Bylaws: _strange year because of the merger effort. Didn’t want to do a lot while the merger was going on. Things are a bit up in the air and could change once accomplished. Did make efforts to get a grasp on the management of documents. Easier to pass on the information.

    1. d.Sponsor Reports
        1. i.NASA 

- -FY2016: citizen science and crowdsourcing. Announcements are not out yet, but have selected 6 team projects.Hearing interest from the community on this.
- -Item being seen: trending towards temporal aspects. How time can allow us to understand earth systems better. A new frontier.
- -From commercial sector & data provided: how can we utilize that data? 
- -Partnership efforts: testbed for AIST has gone really well. Results and Reports have been great and looking forward to building
- -Hack-a-thon, get those engaged from the gaming world
- -The economic ideas on ROI with new administration will be a focus. Value of information for application of data. Move to formal approach with RFF to formally quantify the value of information and earth science data in a Consortium. 
    - -Economic and policy analysis terms/tools used are not as well known to the earth scientists. Want to help build familiarity. How to engage with the ESIP community? 

- -New Work Program (2017-2019) solicitation for the US community to propose what they might do on the data work program. 
- -US hosting the next Geo Plenary (Reagan Building) - an opportunity with the new administration to inform them on earth science data. As start to plan, we need innovative ideas for how to be inviting hosts and connect with the administration. 
- -Methane now a big topic: one of the topics of the new IDS call is going to be related to methane.
- -Thinking about the new administration coming in: politicization of earth science. 2 key talking points that we would like to have ready: 1 earth observation and earth science data are objective, transparent, and policy-neutral, 2) NASA earth science doesn’t prescribe policy. Others use NASA’s data in order to educate/write policy. Which is a good source, since it is objective, transparent, and policy-neutral. 

        1. ii.NOAA 

- -Hope to fund years 2 & 3. 
- -New positions at NOAA - acting administrators have been named

- -Public Access Plan - how to implement the plan. Deployed a huge communication strategy to educate on the new data management policies
