## **5.9 - INDEMNIFICATION BY CORPORATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER AGENTS**

### **5.9.1**

The Corporation may indemnify any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to the extent permitted by Section 29 406.50 et seq of the Act.

### **5.9.2**

In no case, however, shall the Corporation indemnify, reimburse or insure any person for any taxes imposed on such individual under chapter 42 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now in effect or may hereafter be amended (the "Code"). Further, if at any time the Corporation is deemed to be a private foundation within the meaning of section 509 of the Code, then during such time, no payment shall be made under this Section if such payment would constitute on act of self-dealing or a taxable expenditure, as defined in section 4941(d) or 4945(d) of the Code. Moreover, the Corporation shall not indemnify, reimburse or insure any person in any instance where such indemnification, reimbursement or insurance is inconsistent with section 4958 of the Code or any other provision of the Code applicable to corporations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Code.
