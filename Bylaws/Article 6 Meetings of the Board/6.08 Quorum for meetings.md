## **6.8 - QUORUM FOR MEETINGS**

### **6.8.1**

A majority of the directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business except adjournment.

## **6.8.2**

If during a meeting at which a quorum was initially present some directors leave rendering the meeting without a quorum, the Board or committee may continue to transact business so long as any action taken or decision made is approved by at least the number of directors required to take action if a quorum were present.

## **6.8.3**

Except as otherwise provided in these bylaws (including, without limitation, Subsection 6.8.2, above) in the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, or by law, no business shall be considered by the Board at any meeting at which a quorum, as defined above, is not present. The only motion which is permitted at a meeting at which a quorum is not initially present is a motion to adjourn. A majority of the directors present at such meeting may adjourn from time to time until the time fixed for the next regular meeting of the Board.
