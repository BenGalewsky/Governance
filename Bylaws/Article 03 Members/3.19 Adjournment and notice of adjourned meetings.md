## **3.19 - ADJOURNMENT AND NOTICE OF ADJOURNED MEETINGS**

Any membersâ€™ business meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the members represented at the meeting. When a members' business meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken. If after adjournment, a new record date is fixed for notice or voting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each member who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote at the meeting. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting.
