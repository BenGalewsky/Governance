## **3.16 - WAIVER OF NOTICE**

### **3.16.1**

The transaction of any members’ business meeting, however called or noticed and wherever held, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after standard call and notice if:

   **3.16.1.1** - A quorum is present, and  
   **3.16.1.2** - Either before or after the meeting, each member entitled to vote, not present in person, signs a written waiver of notice, a consent to the holding of the meeting, or an approval of the minutes of the meeting. The waiver of notice, consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of the meeting except that, if action is taken or proposed to be taken for approval of any matter specified in Section 3.11.2 of this Article, the waiver of notice, consent or approval shall state the general nature of the proposal. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.

### **3.16.2**

A member’s attendance at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of that meeting unless the member objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if the objection is expressly made at the meeting.
