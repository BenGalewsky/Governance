   **3.15.3.3** - Voting via email, electronic message board and network shall only be permitted and valid if the Corporation has placed in effect reasonable measures to verify that the sender is the member purporting to send the transmission and that creates a record that is capable of retention, retrieval, and review, and that may thereafter be rendered into clearly legible tangible form.  
   **3.15.3.4** - The Corporation may not send a ballot by email if the authority to communicate with the member has been revoked as set forth in Section 3.11.3.

### **3.15.4**
