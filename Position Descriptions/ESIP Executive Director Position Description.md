**About ESIP**

The Foundation for Earth Science Information Partners (dba ESIP) (esipfed.org)is a non-profit 501(c)(3) scientific and education organization created to support research networks and communities that provide the information systems backbone for the dissemination and use of Earth science information. Its primary responsibility is to provide executive support to the Earth science community for these ends.  ESIP was created in 1998 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the recommendation of the National Research Council (NRC) to provide a more responsive system to deliver data and information generated by the Earth Observing System. ESIP is now sponsored by NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The intent of these efforts is to engage the broader Earth science community to facilitate the dissemination and use of Earth science data and information.

As a non-profit corporation, ESIP is overseen by a Board of Directors drawn primarily from the Earth science community.  It is expected that the Executive Director will work with and take direction from the president and chairman of the board on a regular basis.  ESIP currently has two full-time staff members in addition to the Executive Director, the ESIP Lab and Community Directors as well as a part time position that supports operations and Logistics. ESIP contracts additional staff support as needed around ESIP Meetings. The staff members coordinate the online and in person volunteer efforts of more than 110 partner organizations, and organize at least two national meetings per year. The Executive Director is expected to be self-motivated and able to operate independently in a work environment based largely on the use of communications technology rather than daily face-to-face interactions. The position also requires frequent interaction with ESIP sponsors (e.g., NASA, NOAA, and USGS) and with the leadership of the groups that the ESIP serves.
