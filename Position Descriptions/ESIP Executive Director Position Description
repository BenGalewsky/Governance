**POSITION DESCRIPTION**

**Executive Director**

**Foundation for Earth Science**

**Updated July 10, 2014**

The Foundation for Earth Science is seeking applicants for the position
of Executive Director. The Foundation for Earth Science (FES;
[<span class="underline">http://earthsciencefoundation.org/</span>](http://earthsciencefoundation.org/))
is a non-profit 501(c)(3) scientific and education organization created
to support research networks and communities that provide the
information systems backbone for the dissemination and use of
Earth science information. Its primary responsibility is to provide
executive support to the Earth science community for these ends. The
initial and continuing focus of activity for the FES is to support the
Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP Federation;
[<span class="underline">http://esipfed.org/</span>](http://esipfed.org/)).
The ESIP Federation was created in 1998 by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) at the recommendation of the National
Research Council (NRC) to provide a more responsive system to deliver
data and information generated by the Earth Observing System. FES is now
sponsored by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), to support the ESIP Federation and the NOAA
Environmental Data Management Community. FES also receives funding to
lead community engagement activities for the National Science
Foundation’s (NSF) EarthCube initiative
([<span class="underline">http://earthcube.org/</span>](http://earthcube.ning.com/)).
The intent of these efforts is to engage the broader Earth science
community to facilitate the dissemination and use of Earth science data
and information.

As a non-profit corporation, the FES is overseen by a Board of Directors
drawn primarily from the Earth science community. It is expected that
the Executive Director will work with and take direction from the
president and chairman of the board on a regular basis. The FES
currently has two full-time staff members – the Executive Director and
an Information and Virtual Community Director. The staff members
coordinate the online volunteer efforts of more than 150 organizations
drawn largely from the ESIP Federation, and organize at least two
national meetings per year. The Executive Director is expected to be
self-motivated and able to operate independently in a work environment
based largely on the use of communications technology rather than daily
face-to-face interactions. The position also requires frequent
interaction with FES sponsors (e.g., NASA, NOAA, and NSF) and with the
leadership of the groups that the FES serves.
