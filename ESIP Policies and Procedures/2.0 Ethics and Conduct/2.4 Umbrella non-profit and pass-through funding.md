### 2.4 Umbrella non-profit and pass-through funding
ESIP is not equipped to serve as an umbrella non-profit organization. The staff and the leadership are fully engaged in ESIP business. Staff are not available to provide oversight for pass-through funding. ESIP also accepts funding from federal agencies and needs to comply with strict auditing rules that make it more difficult for ESIP to be the funding home for external projects, even those that are led by ESIP members.
