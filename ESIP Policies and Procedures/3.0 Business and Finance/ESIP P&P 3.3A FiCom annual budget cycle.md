1.  <span class="c3 c0">Basis of Accounting</span>

<!-- end list -->

1.  <span class="c3 c0">Policy: The organization uses the accrual basis
    of accounting. The accrual basis is the method of accounting whereby
    revenue and expenses are identified with specific periods of time,
    such as a month or year, and are recorded as incurred. This method
    of recording revenue and expenses is without regard to date of
    receipt or payment of cash.</span>
2.  <span class="c3 c0">Procedure: </span>

<!-- end list -->

1.  <span class="c0">Throughout the fiscal year, expenses are accrued
    into the month in which they are incurred. The books are closed no
    later than the </span><span class="c0">15th of the
    month</span><span class="c3 c0"> after the close of the month.
    Invoices received after closing the books will be counted as a
    current-month expense.</span>
2.  <span class="c3 c0">At the close of the fiscal year, this rule is
    not enforced. All expenses that should be accrued into the prior
    fiscal year, are so accrued, in order to ensure that year-end
    financial statements reflect all expenses incurred during the fiscal
    year. Year-end books are closed no later than 90 days after the end
    of the fiscal year.</span>
3.  <span class="c3 c0">Revenue is always recorded in the month in which
    it was earned or pledged.</span>
