        calculation of average monthly operating costs includes all
        recurring, predictable expenses such as salaries and benefits,
        travel, program, and ongoing professional services.
        
        ESIP must maintain a minimum amount of available funds on
        deposit to ensure that operations can be maintained in the
        absence of funds from a current contract or award. The minimum
        amount of available funds must be equal to the total cost of 3
        months of salaries for all permanent staff members on the
        payroll and to the total cost of 3 months of other current
        overhead expenses.

    b.  Procedure:

        i.  The amount of the operating reserve will be calculated each
            year after approval of the annual budget, reported to the
            Finance Committee and Board of Directors, and included in
            regular financial reports.

        ii. The operating reserve will be funded with surplus
            unrestricted operating funds.

        iii. The Board of Directors may from time to time direct that a
            specific source of revenue be set aside for operating
            reserves. Examples may include one-time gifts or bequests,
            special grants, or special appeals.

        iv. To use the operating reserves, the Executive Director will
            submit a request to the Finance Committee. The request will
            include the analysis and determination of the use of funds
            and plans for replenishment. The organization's goal is to
            replenish the funds used within twelve (12) months to
            restore the operating reserve fund to the target minimum
            amount.

This Policy was approved by the Board of Directors of ESIP on October
17, 2017.
