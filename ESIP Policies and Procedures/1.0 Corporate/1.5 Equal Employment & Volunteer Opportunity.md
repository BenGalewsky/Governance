Application

This Equal Opportunity Policy applies to all of ESIP's staff, whether full-time, part-time, or temporary community members, to all volunteers, to all who provide contract services, and to all officers and directors, each of whom shall be entitled to protection and referred to in this document as community members. 

ESIP is an equal opportunity employer and complies will all applicable federal, state and local fair employment practice laws.  ESIP  strictly prohibits and does not tolerate discrimination against community members, applicants or any other covered persons because of disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation (including a person’s orientation toward heterosexuality, homosexuality, bi-sexuality or transgender status, or ESIP ’s perception thereof), religion, age, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, past, current or prospective service in the uniformed services, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, state or local law.  All community members, other workers and other representatives of ESIP  are prohibited from engaging in unlawful discrimination.  This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including but not limited, hiring, training, promotion, discipline, compensation, benefits and termination of employment.

ESIP  complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), as amended by the ADA Amendments Act and the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act.  Consistent with those requirements, ESIP  will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with a disability if such an accommodation will allow the individual to perform the essential functions of the job, unless doing so would create an undue hardship.  If you believe you need an accommodation, refer any such requests to our Executive Director or a member of the Board’s Personnel Committee.  Please expressly identify your disability accommodations request by expressing it a request under ESIP ’s Disability Accommodations Policy.  ESIP  will also, where appropriate, provide reasonable accommodations for an community member’s religious beliefs or practices.
 
If you are subjected to any conduct that you believe violates this policy, you must promptly speak to, write or otherwise contact your direct supervisor, the Executive Director, or a member of the Board’s Personnel Committee as soon as possible following the offending conduct.  If you have not received a satisfactory response within five (5) business days after reporting any incident that you perceive to be discriminatory conduct, please immediately contact the Executive Director or a member of the Board’s Personnel Committee.   These individuals will ensure that a prompt investigation is conducted.  The complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of all individuals involved and any witnesses.  ESIP  will directly and thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances of all claims of perceived discrimination and will take prompt corrective action, if appropriate.
 
Additionally, any manager or supervisor who observes discriminatory conduct must report the conduct to the Executive Director or a member of the Board’s Personnel Committee so that an investigation can be made and corrective action taken, if appropriate.
 
No one will be subject to, and ESIP  prohibits, any form of discipline, reprisal, intimation or retaliation for good faith reports or complaints of incidents of discrimination of any kind, pursuing any discrimination claim or cooperating in related investigations (See Whistleblower Protection Policy).
 
ESIP  is committed to enforcing this policy against all forms of discrimination.  However, the effectiveness of our efforts depends largely on our community telling us about inappropriate conduct.  If community members feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, they should report it immediately.  If community members do not report discriminatory conduct, ESIP  may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action.  
 
Any community member, regardless of position or title, who ESIP  determines has subjected an individual to discrimination or retaliation in violation of this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment.
 
The Executive Director and Personnel Committee are responsible for the administration of this policy.  If you have any question regarding this policy or questions about discrimination, accommodations or retaliation that are not addressed in this policy, please contact the Executive Director or a Board member of the Personnel Committee.
