Policy and Procedure 1.8 - Use of the ESIP Logo

The ESIP logo can be used by ESIP members for the sole purpose of
acknowledging ESIP support and collaboration. The logo can also be used
to link to a ESIP website or acknowledge ESIP support, collaboration, or
affiliation.

No explicit permission is necessary to use the ESIP logo. ESIP's logo
cannot be used in a manner that falsely implies employment by or
affiliation with ESIP. ESIP's logo cannot be used to imply or endorse a
product or service or used for commercial purposes without permission
from the ESIP Executive Director. ESIP volunteer leadership, as defined
in [[Policy and Procedure 1.3, section 2 part
1]{.underline}](https://github.com/ESIPFed/Governance/blob/master/ESIP%20Policies%20and%20Procedures/1.0%20Corporate/ESIP%20P%26P%201.3%20Corporate%20Organization.md),
can request that a logo be removed if the use is found to be
inappropriate. We request that ESIP staff are informed whenever a member
uses the ESIP logo.

The ESIP logo is a unique design and cannot be accurately reproduced
with any typeface. It must not be hand drawn, scanned or modified in any
way. It should be reproduced from electronic files found here only.

Questions regarding use of the ESIP logo should be sent to
[[staff@esipfed.org]{.underline}](mailto:staff@esipfed.org).

This policy was approved by the ESIP Board on October 23, 2018.
