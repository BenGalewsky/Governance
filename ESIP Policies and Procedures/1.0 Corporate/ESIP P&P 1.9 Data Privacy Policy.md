Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) is committed to protecting your privacy. We respect your right to make choices about the information you share and we do not, rent, or lease your information to third parties. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how ESIP collects information, including certain personally identifiable information, and how ESIP may use, process, and share such information. The Privacy Policy serves as the notice to inform individuals about the collection and use of personally identifiable information that is about them.
By using the ESIP website (“Site”), including any other ESIP managed sites or apps, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. This policy is effective (January 2023). We reserve the right to update or change our policy at any time consistent with the process detailed in the section, ‘Changes to Policy’ below. Your continued use of the Site after we post any modifications to this policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified policy.
In service of our mission, ESIP collects information about those who engage with us and/or visit our Sites (esipfed.org, wiki.esipfed.org, and igniteagu.io). This information and the data derived are used, in part, to improve the communication and supporting the Earth Science data management community, to understand and improve programs and websites, and to serve the interests of partners, meeting attendees and others.

### 2.1. INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION
When accessing our Site, we will learn certain information about you during your visit. Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email addresses and phone number. We may also collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site. Our website utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” (described below) and server logs to collect information about how our Site is used. Information gathered through cookies and server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our site, and the websites visited just before and just after our own, as well as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.
For people participating in ESIP partnerships, meetings, newsletter subscriptions, and other activities, we may also collect other information such as education, employment data, gender, scientific interest. This information will be stored in our community database.
#### 2.1.1. IMAGES AND PHOTOGRAPHY
During ESIP events, staff or participants may gather screen captures and at some in-person events a photographer may take photographs. For all ESIP Meetings, participants are asked during registration to give consent for recording and photo release.
#### 2.2. COOKIES
A “cookie” is a file that a website stores in a user’s computer for future reference. Individuals may set their browsers to reject cookies; however, there are ESIP services that will not fully function unless the user accepts the ESIP cookie. For example, when a user returns to that ESIP service, the cookie will identify the user as a previous visitor. Information supplied through an ESIP cookie is used only by ESIP to help enhance services provided and is not shared with others. 
Web “beacons” are transparent pixel images embedded at certain points on websites that are used to collect information about how users navigate and use the website for the purpose of understanding and improving the function of the site and the value of the content. ESIP uses cookies or other trackers to improve some of its services, provide enhanced functionality on the site, and to aggregate traffic data (i.e., what pages are most popular). 
“Cookies” and “beacons” may also be utilized by the third parties that we contract with to provide certain functions. You may block or disable cookies or other trackers by changing the settings on your browser, but doing so may prevent you from accessing certain functionalities on the Sites.
#### 2.3. WEBSITE ANALYTICS
ESIP gathers web traffic through a third-party service, Google Analytics as well as email marketing, event planning, and social media analytics through other platforms. All information is aggregated and is not personally identifiable. On the ESIPfed.org website we use WordPress plugins to enable acknowledgement of the use of cookies. Users can choose to accept or withhold certain information from Google Analytics in this way.
