D.  **CORRESPONDENCE AND INTERNAL MEMORANDA**

> **General Principle:** Most correspondence and internal memoranda
> should be retained for the same period as the document they pertain to
> or support. For instance, a letter pertaining to a particular contract
> would be retained as long as the contract (7 years after expiration).
> It is recommended that records that support a particular project be
> kept with the project and take on the retention time of that
> particular project file.
>
> Correspondence or memoranda that do not pertain to documents having a
> prescribed retention period should generally be discarded sooner.
> These may be divided into two general categories:

2.  Those pertaining to routine matters and having no significant,
    > lasting consequences should be discarded *within two years.* Some
    > examples include:

-   Routine letters and notes that require no acknowledgment or
    > follow-up, such as notes of appreciation, congratulations, letters
    > of transmittal, and plans for meetings.

-   Form letters that require no follow-up.

-   Letters of general inquiry and replies that complete a cycle of
    > correspondence.

-   Letters or complaints requesting specific action that have no
    > further value after changes are made or action taken (such as name
    > or address change).

-   Other letters of inconsequential subject matter or that definitely
    > close correspondence to which no further reference will be
    > necessary.

-   Chronological correspondence files.

> Please note that copies of interoffice correspondence and documents
> where a copy will be in the originating department file should be read
> and destroyed, unless that information provides reference to or
> direction to other documents and must be kept for project
> traceability.

3.  Those pertaining to non-routine matters or having significant
    > lasting consequences should generally be retained permanently.

E.  **ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS**

<!-- -->

1.  **Electronic Mail**: Not all email needs to be retained, depending
    > on the subject matter.

-   Staff will strive to keep all but an insignificant minority of their
    > e-mail related to business issues.

-   Staff will not store or transfer ESIP-related e-mail on
    > non-work-related computers except as necessary or appropriate for
    > ESIP purposes.

-   Staff will take care not to send confidential/proprietary ESIP
    > information to outside sources.

-   Any e-mail staff deems vital to the performance of their job should
    > be sent to Highrise.

2.  Electronic Documents: including Google Docs, Microsoft Office Suite
    > and PDF files. Retention also depends on the subject matter.

    -   **PDF documents** -- The length of time that a PDF file should
        > be retained should be based upon the content of the file and
        > the category under the various sections of this policy. The
        > maximum period that a PDF file should be retained is 6 years.
        > PDF files the employee deems vital to the performance of his
        > or her job should be printed and stored in the employee's
        > workspace.

    -   **Text/formatted files** - Staff will conduct annual reviews of
        > all text/formatted files (e.g., Google Docs, Microsoft Word
        > documents) and will delete all those they consider unnecessary
        > or outdated. After five years, all text files will be deleted
        > from the network and the staff's desktop/laptop.

> ESIP does not automatically delete electronic files beyond the dates
> specified in this Policy. It is the responsibility of all staff to
> adhere to the guidelines specified in this policy.
>
> All employees should maintain a backup of their work computer.
>
> In certain cases a document will be maintained in both paper and
> electronic form. In such cases the official document will be the
> electronic document.
